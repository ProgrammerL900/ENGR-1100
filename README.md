# ENGR-1100
Intro to Engineering group project using Greenfoot environment. Our project was a soccer game that you had to get a certain number of points to win without being blocked by the goalie or hitting the iceburgs that were around. You moved around your character by using the mouse.

Working in a team of four or five students, you are required to propose, design, implement, and deliver a software application developed with Greenfoot in one of the following three categories.

Education - Applications in this category must teach a skill to a specific audience (for example: teach math to third graders, teach reading skills to first graders, teach foreign language skills to adults), or present a concept in terms of an explanatory simulation (for example: simulate laws of motion, crowd behavior, swarm behavior, etc.).

Entertainment - Applications in this category must be designed primarily for entertainment purposes. For example: A game with clear rules, goals, etc.

Modeling and Simulation - Applications in this category must be designed primarily for research or scientific purposes. For example: modeling the spread of a disease, simulating the interactions of subatomic particles, empirically deriving scientific constants, etc.

Project scope
Your team is free to make your project most anything that you want, provided that it meets the following minimum requirements.

At least four different subclasses of Actor that have meaningful interaction in the world.
At least one World subclass that appropriately configures an initial scenario and tracks world-level information (e.g., a score or other status information).
Each of the following examples of control structure: sequence, decision, and iteration.
Incorporation of sound.
Interactive input and control from the user.
Enough complexity and runtime options that will cause the program to run for at least one minute.
